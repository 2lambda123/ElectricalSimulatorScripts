This project is to make a simple, but useful training program to be able to teach young electricians consepts about electricity in a safe way with visualizations you cannot get in the real world.

## Goals:
  * Fully functioning multimeter that behaves how you would expect it to in the real world
  * Have a library of different issues that may arrise and how to troubleshoot
  * Implement VR so the user can be immersed and because that's cool af
  * Record some voice overs that explain exactly what is going on
  * Implement troubleshooting. Something the user can interact with ie open boxes, connect wires with wirenuts, find faults
  * Injury system with an avatar? Show the effects a blast can do it a body ie arc burns or adc blasts
